# FEFL03-HandsOn
Switch/Case and If/Else Ternary Hands On answer.
In this repo you will find the answer to a hands on I personally struggled with. I spent almost two days trying to figure this one out.
It is actually alot simpler than it looks, given you spend enough time to understand the syntax and comprehend what the problems are asking you to do.
Anyways, your syntax structure may differ a bit from mine and that is okay! As long as it works and you can move on to the next lesson!
I hope this helps other students get by and offer a little relief later on in the future!
